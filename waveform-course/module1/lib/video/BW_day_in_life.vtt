My name is Jason Weber, and my job is to make Internet Explorer fast.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.305
We care about Windows users, and Windows users spend over half their time inside the web browser.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.199
We want those users to have a great experience 


00:00:17.368 --> 00:00:18.390
and that means performance.


00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:22.593
Regularly on any given day we will measure the performance of IE hundreds of times


00:00:22.853 --> 00:00:25.504
typically using thousands of different tests
