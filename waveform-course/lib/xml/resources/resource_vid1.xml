			<p>Welcome to the high-tech Research, Development and Quality building. We call this function RDQI for short.</p>
			<p>Our visit here will take about half an hour. During that time you'll see how the global RDQI teams <b>discover</b> the science and technology to meet our consumers' needs. You'll find out how they <b>develop</b> delicious new products and then <b>deploy</b> them into markets across the world.</p>
			<p>Here at RDQI our teams don't just create our tasty snacks, they also design the processes to make them. We develop and create all the packaging too.</p> 
			<p>Most importantly, we make sure our products are safe, comply with local regulations, and meet the high quality consumers expect.</p>
			<p>You can leave the tour at any time and come back whenever you like. You'll start at the same point you left.</p>
			<p>Let's go in!</p>
