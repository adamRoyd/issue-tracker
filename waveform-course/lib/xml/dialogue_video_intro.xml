			<p>Welcome to the Finance function. It's a very grand and impressive building; it looks a bit like a bank, and the teams here are really friendly. We're going to find out about the role Finance plays across MondelÄ“z International and which other functions they collaborate with. We'll take a closer look at the different teams within Finance and you'll learn which ones can help you with your job.</p> <p>Our visit here will last about 30 minutes. If you need to stop and leave at any point, no problem! Come back  another time and you can re-join the tour at the same place.</p>
			<p>Let's go up the steps and inside.</p>
